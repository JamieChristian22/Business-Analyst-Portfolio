## Business problem

Manual IAM across RCM apps creates slow onboarding/offboarding, inconsistent access reviews, and audit gaps for HIPAA/privacy.  
**Goal:** implement/expand IAM using **SailPoint** to automate Joiner/Mover/Leaver, strengthen governance, and provide audit-ready evidence.

| Offboarding access removal | 1–3 days | **< 1 hour** (critical apps) |
| Access review completion | 60–70% on time | **> 95% on time** |
| Audit evidence gathering | ad-hoc | **standardized evidence pack** |
