# Support Runbook (Service Desk + IAM)

## Common issues
- **Approval delays:** check task owner; escalate after 24 hours
- **Provisioning failure:** check connector error; retry; escalate if repeated
- **Missing birthright role:** validate HR attributes; refresh identity; document correction

## Escalation
Tier 1 → Tier 2 → IAM Ops → Integration/App Team → Vendor (if needed)

## SLA targets
- New hire provisioning: < 8 hours
- Termination deprovisioning: < 1 hour (critical apps)
- Standard requests: < 2 business days
